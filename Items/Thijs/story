You are a private investegator for a local police station and you where assigned to solve the case of the missing christmas children. Every year children from all kinds of families but only on christmas. You try to collect as much info as you can with the families neighbours you try to collect fingerprints and dna samples though for some reason you are unable to find any. The kidnapper is a master at the art having kipnapped many children without leaving evidence, even the people they where last seen with were their families. 
The officer noticed you weren’t making any progress on the case making them set this to a cold case, but you where determind to find who was doing this and why, so you continued the investegation in your spare time, and just in case you put a tracker and body cam on your son’s clothes to make sure he will be safe. Your son wasn’t that old for he had only gone to school for 2 years now. You always brought him to school and took him home to make sure he is safe and it always makes him very happy to see you.
Before you became a investegator you where always a bit of a sceptic / believer in the paranormal though you could never prove any of it was real and you thought maybe as a investegator you could prove it tob e real and existing. You never believed in any voodoo or fortuneteller stuff but you did believe in ghosts and monsters to be real, but your partner always said that it was crazy to think ghosts where real and sometimes you thought so too but you always found some reason tot hink that it is real.
On christmas eve you came home from work and you noticed your child has moved to a far away location, the body cam somehow got disabled so you decide to try and follow the kidnapper to find out what he is doing with your son and why he is doing what he is doing, you have to put a end to his reign of terror and you have to save the kipnapped children so they can return to their families you just hope its not to late for them to be saved. Because you wish anything but the death of kidnapped kids to be on your concious.
